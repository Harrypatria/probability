## Introduction

This repository serves as a practice and reference guide for probability distributions commonly used in statistics, data science, and applied mathematics. It includes practical R code examples, formulas, and visualizations for key distributions, such as:

- Normal Distribution: Modeling continuous data with a bell-curve shape.
- Poisson Distribution: Modeling event counts in a fixed interval or space.
- Exponential Distribution: Modeling the time between events in a Poisson process.

## Purpose
The goal of this exercise is to:
- Reinforce understanding of statistical concepts and their real-world applications.
- Provide hands-on examples of probability calculations in R.
- Enable data-driven decision-making through statistical modeling (e.g., equipment replacement analysis).
- Visualize probability distributions to aid in intuitive learning.

## Who Should Use This Repository?
This repository is ideal for:
Students looking to practice statistical concepts.
Data scientists and statisticians brushing up on probability theory.
Programmers seeking to incorporate statistical modeling in their workflows.
